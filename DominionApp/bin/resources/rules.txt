You start your turn with 1 Action and 1 Buy. This means you can play one 
Action card in the Action Phase, and buy one card in the Buy phase. Your turn consists of 
the Action phase, the Buy phase and the Clean-up phase.
A – Action phase
You may play an Action card from your hand. Follow the instructions on the card. See 8. Playing a card.
After you have fully resolved an Action card, you may play another Action card, 
but only if you have an unused Action remaining. (Some cards give more Actions.)
B – Buy phase
First, you may play as many Treasure cards as you like from your hand, in any order. For each card, 
follow the instructions on the card. Treasures produce coins, but may also do other things. 
After you have played your Treasure cards, you may buy a card 
by using (paying) any of the coins you have produced this turn. 
The card can cost no more than the unused coins you have left, 
but may cost less. A card costing 0 coins can be bought even when you have no coins.
You may only buy a card that is available in the Supply. You then gain it in your deck.
If you have more Buys, you may buy more cards, for the unused coins you have left. (Some cards give more Buys.)
C – Clean-up phase
Discard all the cards in your play area and all the cards left in your hand. Discard these cards in any order, 
but when you discard your hand, discard it all at once.
Then draw a new hand of 5 cards from your deck. See 14. Moving cards from your deck.
the game ends at the end of a player's turn if either the pile of Provinces is empty, or any 3 
Supply piles are empty. Your discard pile, and your hand, are put in your deck before counting victory points.
